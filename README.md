## Theory
#### Electric Field: 
The electric field E around a charge is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a positive test charge placed in the field. It is defined as:

                       E=F/q

#### Electric Potential:
The electric potential V at a point in an electric field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point, without any acceleration. It is given by:
               
                       V=k⋅Q/r
For multiple point charges, the total potential is the sum of the potentials due to each charge.

## Usage examples
### 1. Basic Simulation of Electric Potential and Field
The main components of the simulation are:
 - Electric potential (V): The electric potential at a point in space due to a charge is given by:
   
                                  V = k . q/r
 where:
  - k is Coulomb's constant.
  - q is the charge.
  - r is the distance from the charge to the point in space.

 - Electric field (E): The electric field is the gradient of the potential:
   
                                   E=−∇V

The simulation computes the potential and electric field at each point in a 2D grid for one or more point charges.
### 2. Example of Single Charge Simulation
```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define constants
k = 8.99e9  # Coulomb's constant (N·m²/C²)

# Define the grid
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
y = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Define the charge and its position
charge = 1e-9  # in Coulombs
charge_pos = (0, 0)

# Calculate the distance from the charge
R = np.sqrt((X - charge_pos[0])**2 + (Y - charge_pos[1])**2)

# Calculate the potential
V = k * charge / R

# Plot the potential as a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.contourf(X, Y, V, levels=50, cmap='plasma')
plt.colorbar(label='Electric Potential (V)')
plt.title('Electric Potential from a Single Charge')
plt.xlabel('x (m)')
plt.ylabel('y (m)')
plt.show()
```

### 3.Visualizing the Electric Field
To visualize the electric field vectors, we calculate the gradient of the potential in the x and y directions and plot the resulting vectors.
```Python
# Calculate the electric field as the negative gradient of the potential
Ex, Ey = np.gradient(-V)

# Plot the electric field as vectors using quiver
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.contourf(X, Y, V, levels=50, cmap='plasma')
plt.quiver(X, Y, Ex, Ey, color='white')
plt.colorbar(label='Electric Potential (V)')
plt.title('Electric Field from Multiple Charges')
plt.xlabel('x (m)')
plt.ylabel('y (m)')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion
This Python tool enables users to visualize electric fields and potentials from various charge distributions in a 2D space. By modifying the charges list and utilizing the plotting features, users can gain insights into the behavior of electric fields in different scenarios.
