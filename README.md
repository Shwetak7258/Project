## Project Overview
This project provides a Python tool to simulate electric fields and potentials generated by simple charge distributions in a two-dimensional space. The simulation visualizes electric lines of force and the scalar electric potential, allowing users to better understand electrostatic concepts.

## Features
- Simulate point charges and uniform charge distributions.
- Visualize electric field lines and equipotential lines.
- Interactive plots to explore electric fields.
- Export plots for presentations or reports.Requirements

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Theory
#### Electric Field: 
The electric field E around a charge is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a positive test charge placed in the field. It is defined as:

                       E=F/q
